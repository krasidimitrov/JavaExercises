INSERT INTO Books VALUES (1, 'Man\'s Search for Meaning', 'Beacon Press', 2006, 'Man’s Search for Meaning by Victor E. Frankl. Epiphany Library section 7 B: The Church in the World: Politics/War/Peace. This was voted one of the 100 most influential religious books of the 20th century and certainly deserves a place in our library. Frankl was a survivor of four concentration camps during the Holocaust. The book’s first part is his concentration camp memoir, but it goes beyond a simple memoir. It is about the psychology of those who were imprisoned. Frankl, a young doctor and psychiatrist, observed and later wrote about how camp prisoners dealt with concentration camp life – some transcended it, others committed suicide, others just gave up and died. He grew to realize that those who survived found some sort of meaning in their existence, especially in their suffering. It ennobled them! ');
